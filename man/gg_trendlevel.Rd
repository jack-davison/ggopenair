\usage{
gg_trendlevel(
  data,
  pollutant,
  x = "month",
  y = "hour",
  facet = "default",
  statistic = c("mean", "max", "frequency"),
  stat_args,
  stat_safemode
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The openair data frame to use to generate the \code{trendLevel}
plot.}

\item{pollutant}{The name of the data series in \code{mydata} to sample to
produce the \code{trendLevel} plot.}

\item{x, y, facet}{The name of the data series with which to bin \code{mydata}.
`x` and `y` form the x and y axes of the resulting plot, and `facet` is
optionally used to separate the plot into separate panels. Duplication in
\code{x}, \code{y} and \code{facet} are not permitted.}

\item{statistic}{The statistic method to be use to summarise locally binned
\code{pollutant} measurements with. Three options are currently encoded:
\dQuote{mean} (default), \dQuote{max} and \dQuote{frequency}. (Note:
Functions can also be sent directly via \code{statistic}.  However, this
option is still in development and should be used with caution. See Details
below.)}

\item{stat_args}{Additional options to be used with \code{statistic} if this
is a function. The extra options should be supplied as a list of named
parameters. (see Details below.)}

\item{stat_safemode}{An addition protection applied when using functions
direclty with \code{statistic} that most users can ignore. This option
returns \code{NA} instead of running \code{statistic} on binned subsamples
that are empty. Many common functions terminate with an error message when
applied to an empty dataset. So, this option provides a mechanism to work
with such functions. For a very few cases, e.g. for a function that counted
missing entries, it might need to be set to \code{FALSE} (see Details
below.)}
}
\value{
As well as generating the plot itself, \code{trendLevel} also returns
  an object of class ``openair''. The object includes three main components:
  \code{call}, the command used to generate the plot; \code{data}, the data
  frame of summarised information used to make the plot; and \code{plot}, the
  plot itself. If retained, e.g. using \code{output <- trendLevel(mydata)},
  this output can be used to recover the data, reproduce or rework the
  original plot or undertake further analysis.

  An openair output can be manipulated using a number of generic operations,
  including \code{print}, \code{plot} and \code{summary}.

  Summary statistics can also be extracted directly using \code{results},
  e.g.  \code{results(object)} for \code{output <- trendLevel(mydata)}.

\description{
The trendLevel function provides a way of rapidly showing a large amount of
data in a condensed form. In one plot, the variation in the concentration of
one pollutant can to shown as a function of three other categorical
properties. The default version of the plot uses y = hour of day, x = month
of year and type = year to provide information on trends, seasonal effects
and diurnal variations. However, x, y and type and summarising statistics can
all be modified to provide a range of other similar plots.
}
\details{
\code{trendLevel} allows the use of third party summarising functions via the
\code{statistic} option. Any additional function arguments not included
within a function called using \code{statistic} should be supplied as a list
of named parameters and sent using \code{stat.args}. For example, the encoded
option \code{statistic = "mean"} is equivalent to \code{statistic = mean,
stat.args = list(na.rm = TRUE)} or the R command \code{mean(x, na.rm= TRUE)}.
Many R functions and user's own code could be applied in a similar fashion,
subject to the following restrictions: the first argument sent to the
function must be the data series to be analysed; the name `x' cannot be used
for any of the extra options supplied in \code{stat.args}; and the function
should return the required answer as a numeric or \code{NA}. Note: If the
supplied function returns more than one answer, currently only the first of
these is retained and used by \code{trendLevel}. All other returned
information will be ignored without warning. If the function terminates with
an error when it is sent an empty data series, the option
\code{stat.safe.mode} should not be set to \code{FALSE} or \code{trendLevel}
may fail. Note: The \code{stat.safe.mode = TRUE} option returns an NA without
warning for empty data series.
