> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This package is no longer under active development. Future developments, including the adoption of `ggplot2`, will be undertaken within the main `openair` package.

The goal of `ggopenair` is to bridge the gap between the data analysis
functions of `openair` and the flexibility of `ggplot2`. One of the key
strengths of `ggplot2` over `lattice` is that it allows plots to be
manipulated *after* they are created, which allows for a much more
flexible plotting experience. Unlike `lattice`, `ggplot2` is also being
actively developed and extended, which `ggopenair` can take advantage
of.
