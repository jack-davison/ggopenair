The goal of `ggopenair` is to bridge the gap between the data analysis
functions of `openair` and the flexibility of `ggplot2`. One of the key
strengths of `ggplot2` over `lattice` is that it allows plots to be
manipulated *after* they are created, which allows for a much more
flexible plotting experience. `ggplot2` is also being actively developed
and extended, which `ggopenair` can take advantage of.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggopenair from
